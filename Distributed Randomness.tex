% Computational / communication / adversarial models

\subsection{Commit-Reveal}
In the case of a strawman solution, the classical commit-reveal provides an intuitive way to source a random number from a group of nodes by first allowing each node to commit (in the cryptographic sense) to a secret random number and then adding all shares (revealed later) from all nodes to compute the final random number of a round. The problem with this is that the last person to reveal his share can in fact check the round's output faster than others and hence can decide not to reveal his number if he doesn't like the round's output, biasing the distributed randomness. This is called the \textit{last revealer attack}.

\subsection{Verifiable Secret Sharing}
The issue with the classical Shamir's secret sharing scheme is that either the dealer or other participants could in fact be acting maliciously, e.g. Alice (a participant) needs to trust that she has received her share correctly from the dealer while she also needs to trust that other participants' revealed shares are correct.

This issue can be fixed by the notion of verifiable secret sharing (VSS). The idea is that we add an additional verification process to the usual Shamir's secret sharing scheme. Here, we take note of two commonly used VSS schemes: Feldman-VSS and Pedersen-VSS.

The mathematical setup is as follows. We choose primes $p$ and $q$ such that $q \mid p - 1$ and let $g$ be a generator of $G_q$, a cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$. This setup has the effect of achieving the following: $a \equiv b \pmod q \iff g^a \equiv g^b \pmod p$. As a result, it should be understood that modular arithmetics are done in modulo $q$ whenever the numbers involved concern the exponents while in modulo $p$ otherwise. For convenience, we may omit mod $p$ such that one can aptly assume arithmetics are done in modulo $p$ given an equation unless stated otherwise.

\subsubsection{Feldman-VSS}
The following summarizes a simple VSS scheme (where $t$ among $n$ participants can reconstruct the group secret) proposed by Paul Feldman.

\begin{itemize}
\item $f(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{t - 1} a_i x^i$ is randomly selected by the dealer, where $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and $f(0) = a_0$ is the secret
\item The shares are $f(1), f(2), ..., f(n)$ in mod $q$ and are distributed to $n$ participants, respectively
\item Also distributed from the dealer are commitments to coefficients of $f$, i.e. $c_j = g^{a_j}$ for $j = 0, ..., t - 1$
\item Given her share $f(k)$ and the polynomial coefficient commitments, Alice (a participant) can verify her share by checking:
$$g^{f(k)} = g^{\sum_{i = 0}^{t - 1} a_i k^i} = \prod_{j = 0}^{t - 1} c_j^{k^j} = c_0 c_1^k c_2^{k^2} \cdots c_{t - 1}^{k^{t - 1}}$$
\item Any $t$ number of participants (say) $i = 1, 2, ..., t$ can recover the secret $a_0$ by performing Lagrange interpolation involving Lagrange coefficients $\lambda_i = \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{j}{j - i}$ in mod $q$:
$$a_0 = f(0) = \sum_{i = 1}^{t} f(i) \lambda_i$$
\end{itemize}

What is new here (compared to Shamir's secret sharing scheme) is the inclusion of commitments to polynomial coefficients in the scheme. These commitments enable participants to verify the validity of their corresponding shares.

\subsubsection{Pedersen-VSS}
Reminiscent of Pedersen commitment, Pedersen-VSS is a variation that involves two random polynomials generated by the dealer as opposed to one. Namely, the scheme runs as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item $f(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{t - 1} a_i x^i$ and $f'(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{t - 1} b_i x^i$ are randomly selected by the dealer, where $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and $f(0) = a_0$ is the secret (as before)
\item The shares are $(f(1), f'(1)), ..., (f(n), f'(n))$ in mod $q$ and are distributed to $n$ participants, respectively
\item Also distributed from the dealer are commitments to coefficients of $f$ and $f'$, i.e. $c_j = g^{a_j} h^{b_j}$ for $j = 0, ..., t - 1$
\item Given her share $(f(k), f'(k))$ and the polynomial coefficient commitments, Alice (a participant) can verify her share by checking:
$$g^{f(k)} h^{f'(k)} = \prod_{j = 0}^{t - 1} c_j^{k^j}$$
\item Any $t$ number of participants (say) $i = 1, 2, ..., t$ can recover the secret $a_0$ by performing Lagrange interpolation involving Lagrange coefficients $\lambda_i = \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{j}{j - i}$ in mod $q$:
$$a_0 = f(0) = \sum_{i = 1}^{t} f(i) \lambda_i$$
\end{itemize}

Effectively, what Pedersen-VSS is able to achieve is the decoupling of $g^{a_0}$ (as the public key corresponding to the secret key $a_0$) and $g^{a_0} h^{b_0}$ (as the published commitment for verification purposes). In other words, the verification process in which the participants verify their shares does not (even information-theoretically) leak any information regarding the initial secret $a_0$, a fact that is not true with Feldman-VSS.

\subsection{Distributed Key Generation}
The motivation for distributed key generation (DKG), which basically comprises $n$ parallel instances of a VSS (run by each participant), is to achieve and utilize a group secret in a leaderless manner such that any threshold $t$ number of participants should be able to recover the same group secret. The basic idea is that each participant becomes a dealer (i.e. leader) for a VSS, in which case the protocol deals with $n$ random polynomials in mod $q$ $\{f_i\}_{i = 1, ..., n}$ as opposed to one. Though not computed explicitly, the implicit group polynomial $f = \sum f_i$ then embeds the group secret in the form of $f(0)$ (denoted by $x$) as well as the corresponding public key $g^{f(0)}$ (denoted by $y$) via commitments to coefficients of $f_i$ as per each VSS. Notably, this facet is the one that allows a leaderless configuration where there does not exist a leader for $f$ even if each participant $P_i$ remains a leader for $f_i$ with the knowledge of $f_i(0)$. As a result, it is only collectively (i.e. with the collaboration of at least $t$ number of nodes in a group) that the group can make use of $x$ and $y$ in the typical sense of asymmetric cryptography (e.g. signing a message) after performing a DKG.

Before delineating the process of a DKG, we include what it means for a DKG to be uniformly secure. Namely, a uniformly secure DKG should satisfy the following three correctness properties and one secrecy property.

\begin{definition}
In the setting where at most $t - 1$ nodes can be controlled by an attacker without compromising the protocol, a DKG is \textit{uniformly secure} if the following properties are satisfied.\\

\textbf{Correctness}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any subset of shares of size $t$ can be used to recover the same group secret key $x$.
\item All honest parties have access to the same public key $y = g^x$.
\item $x$ is uniformly distributed in $\mathbb{Z}_q$, and thus $y$ is uniformly distributed in $G_q$ (subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$ generated by $g$).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Secrecy}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Other than from the fact that $y = g^x$, no information on $x$ is leaked. Equivalently, this can be stated using a simulator $SIM$: for every probabilistic polynomial-time adversary $\mathcal{A}$, there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time simulator $SIM$ that, given $y \in G_q$ as input, produces an output distribution which is polynomially indistinguishable from $\mathcal{A}$'s view of a DKG protocol that ends with $y$ as its public key output while $\mathcal{A}$ is allowed to corrupt up to $t - 1$ participants.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The third correctness property is the one that motivates the .........

\subsubsection{Joint-Feldman}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each participant $P_i$ runs a Feldman-VSS by choosing a random polynomial $f_i(z) = \sum_{j = 0}^{t - 1} a_{ij} z^j$ and sending a ``subshare" $f_i(j)$ to player $P_j$ for all $j$
\item To satisfy the verifiability portion of the VSS, $P_i$ broadcasts $A_{ik} = g^{a_{ik}}$
\item Upon receiving the subshares and the corresponding commitments (e.g. in the form of a verification vector), $P_j$ can use the verification mechanism per VSS to verify the subshares. If a verification fails, $P_j$ can broadcast a complaint against $P_i$.
\item If $P_i$ receives at least $t$ complaints, then $P_i$ is disqualified. Otherwise, $P_i$ needs to reveal the subshare $f_i(j)$ per $P_j$ that has broadcasted a complaint. We call $QUAL$ the set of non-disqualified players.
\item Once $QUAL$ is set, we define $f(z) = \sum_{i \in QUAL} f_i(z) = \sum_{i = 0}^{t - 1} a_i z^i$ such that each participant $P_j$ in $QUAL$ can compute the group public key $y = g^{f(0)} = \prod_{i \in QUAL} A_{i0}$, commitments to $f$'s coefficients $A_k = g^{a_k} = \prod_{i \in QUAL} A_{ik}$, and $P_j$'s share (of the group secret) from subshares $f(j) = \sum_{i \in QUAL} f_i(j)$. Though not computed explicitly, the group secret key $x$ is then equal to both $\sum_{i \in QUAL} a_{i0}$ and the Lagrange interpolation involving the shares $\{f(j)\}_{j \in QUAL}$.
\end{enumerate}

% Remove commitments to $f$'s coefficients above?

\subsubsection{Joint-Pedersen}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each participant $P_i$ runs a Pedersen-VSS by choosing two random polynomials $f_i(z) = \sum_{j = 0}^{t - 1} a_{ij} z^j$ and $f'_i(z) = \sum_{j = 0}^{t - 1} b_{ij} z^j$ and sending a ``subshare" $(f_i(j), f'_i(j))$ to player $P_j$ for all $j$
\item To satisfy the verifiability portion of the VSS, $P_i$ broadcasts $C_{ik} = g^{a_{ik}} h^{b_{ik}}$
\item Upon receiving the subshares and the corresponding commitments (e.g. in the form of a verification vector), $P_j$ can use the verification mechanism per VSS to verify the subshares. If a verification fails, $P_j$ can broadcast a complaint against $P_i$.
\item If $P_i$ receives at least $t$ complaints, then $P_i$ is disqualified. Otherwise, $P_i$ needs to reveal the subshare $(f_i(j), f'_i(j))$ per $P_j$ that has broadcasted a complaint. We call $QUAL$ the set of non-disqualified players.
\item Once $QUAL$ is set, we define $f(z) = \sum_{i \in QUAL} f_i(z) = \sum_{i = 0}^{t - 1} a_i z^i$ such that each participant $P_j$ in $QUAL$ can compute the group public key $y = g^{f(0)} = \prod_{i \in QUAL} A_{i0}$, commitments to $f$'s coefficients $A_k = g^{a_k} = \prod_{i \in QUAL} A_{ik}$, and $P_j$'s share (of the group secret) from subshares $f(j) = \sum_{i \in QUAL} f_i(j)$. Though not computed explicitly, the group secret key $x$ is then equal to both $\sum_{i \in QUAL} a_{i0}$ and the Lagrange interpolation involving the shares $\{f(j)\}_{j \in QUAL}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing}
While VSS allows verification of the involved shares, the fact of the matter is that such verification can only be done by the involved participants in the secret sharing process. In other words, VSS' verification process is not public. Publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), on the other hand, involves a public verification process, which is useful and desirable in models such as the public bulletin model or blockchain. Here, we delineate Schoenmakers' PVSS scheme and Scrape's optimization of it.
